The Ritual Drone

This research explores how sustained drones can alter perceptions of time and narrative. Drawing on ethnographic studies of ritual music across cultures, we identify common traits: minimal harmonic movement, continuous tone, and the absence of clear rhythmic markers. In experimental sessions, participants reported time dilation and dissolution of linear thought patterns. Spectral analysis revealed slowly evolving overtones responsible for these effects. We argue that ritual drones function as temporal suspension devices, facilitating psychological states beyond conventional concert experiences. Future studies will test combinations with visual minimalism and controlled lighting.
