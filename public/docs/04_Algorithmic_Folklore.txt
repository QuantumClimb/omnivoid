Algorithmic Folklore

This research examined how modular synthesizers produce emergent, quasi-organic patterns when patched with generative logic modules. Unlike sequenced music, these systems generate evolving motifs that resist repetition. We observed that listeners consistently described the output in anthropomorphic terms—“breathing,” “whispering,” or “alive.” This phenomenon raises questions about human tendency to project agency onto machines. By analyzing patch diagrams and output waveforms, we catalogued several recurring behaviors: chaotic pulsing, recursive modulation, and harmonic drift. We propose that these patterns constitute an evolving folklore of machines—algorithmic myths told through voltage and waveform. The next phase will explore integrating real-time audience data to influence the generative process, creating a participatory sonic organism.
