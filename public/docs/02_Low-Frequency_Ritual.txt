Low-Frequency Ritual

This investigation centered on the physiological and emotional impact of continuous low-frequency tones, ranging between 25–60 Hz. Test subjects were exposed to sine sweeps and fixed bass drones over 40-minute intervals. Responses ranged from mild euphoria to intense somatic sensations, including perceived shifts in heart rate and spatial awareness. Preliminary findings align with studies linking infrasound to altered states of consciousness. Our research suggests that when presented in a controlled environment—low lighting, minimal visuals—these frequencies facilitate a ritualistic atmosphere conducive to introspection and trance. Future research will focus on combining bass drones with subtle harmonic overtones to explore the threshold where vibration transforms into perceived melody.
