Resonant Architecture

Abandoned structures often carry sonic signatures unlike any conventional venue. In our recent exploration of derelict textile mills in Chennai, we discovered how decaying walls, broken windows, and hollow stairwells form natural resonant chambers that radically shape sound. When drone tones and field recordings are projected into these environments, micro-echoes create a layered temporal effect, turning simple signals into dense, evolving textures. This study proposes that urban ruins can be reimagined as living instrumentsâ€”architectural filters that color and modulate sound in unpredictable ways. By mapping their frequency responses and impulse reflections, we can document these unique acoustic identities before they vanish under redevelopment. Future experiments will attempt live performances within these locations, combining site-specific frequencies, generative visuals, and improvised noise to highlight the interplay between decay and sonic memory.
