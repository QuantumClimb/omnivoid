Field Recording in Transitional Zones

Transitional spaces—ports, checkpoints, borders—possess a distinctive sonic ecology shaped by flux and uncertainty. Our fieldwork focused on Chennai’s harbor, capturing cranes in motion, container impacts, and maritime radio chatter. When layered with granular synthesis, these sounds revealed hidden rhythms and tonalities. The project challenges conventional field recording approaches by emphasizing impermanence: many of the captured sounds vanish as infrastructure evolves. We argue that transitional zones are critical to understanding the contemporary soundscape, as they compress global and local sonic identities into fragile, temporary compositions.
